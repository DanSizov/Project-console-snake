A console game built on C using 2 structures each consists of 1 symbol: TypeSnake as a head of a snake and TypeTail as a tail.

Each and every time head eats food it gains 1 tail symbol.

Movement explanataion.

Every tail symbol has got the previous position of the tail symbol in front of it as a buffer.

Every time the snake moves, each and every tail symbol moves to the previous coordinates of the tail symbol in front of it. The first tail symbol has got the position of head.

The snake moves constantly using WASD as movement keys. 

btw if a snake head goes into the wall it continues moving startinf drom the opposite wall.
